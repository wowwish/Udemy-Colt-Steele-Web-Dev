/* 

Passport is a module that provides and automates user authentication for Express. It is mostly used to support 
authentication sessions over HTTP.

Configuration:

In app.js add the following require statement:
	
const passport = require('passport');

To configure passport correctly, you need to provide three things:

    An Authentication Strategy
    Application Middleware
    Sessions

Authentication strategies are a way for passport to delegate authentication to other modular packages. For example, 
there are Node packages that provide passport authentication strategies for Facebook and Twitter, etc.

For our local use case, the strategy is provided by the passport-local package. Passport provides the use() function 
for plugging in the strategy (weâ€™ll be doing that differently later), and it generally looks like this when using 
mongoose:
	
const passport = require('passport'), 
  LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;
  
passport.use(new LocalStrategy(
  function(username, password, done) {
    User.findOne({ username: username }, function (err, user) {
      if (err) { return done(err); }
      if (!user) {
        return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username.' });
      }
      if (!user.validPassword(password)) {
        return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect password.' });
      }
      return done(null, user);
    });
  }
));

Youâ€™ll notice that the callback function provided to the LocalStrategy object is the one that contains the logic used 
to verify a userâ€™s identity.

The verify callback must return a model of the user when the authentication is successful (the credentials are valid).

In our case it is a mongoose model of the User that will be returned. How this model is constructed will be covered 
once we discuss the passport-local-mongoose package.

Once a strategy has been supplied, the relevant middleware has to be configured with Express so our web server can use 
passport. In an app.js file, it generally looks like the following:
	
const session = require("express-session");
  
app.use(session({ secret: "cats" }));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // express body-parser
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());

The order of these statements are important, so keep that in mind.
Using Sessions with Passport

For supporting sessions, passport has to be added as a middleware to the login route or endpoint that you are using 
to authenticate your users, usually with the redirect route values for your application:
	
// Use the passport middleware for authentication
app.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local', {
    successRedirect: '/dashboard',
    failureRedirect: '/login'
}));

When a POST request with the userâ€™s login information is made to the '/login' route, passport uses the local 
authentication strategy to verify that the userâ€™s credentials are valid.

It then serializes the provided User model into one value that is stored in the session object provided by 
express-session.

When future requests from the same user are made with the session cookie, passport uses the serialized session value 
to deserialize or retrieve the User model.

This User object is made available through the request.user property.

In this way, passport builds upon the functionality provided by the express-session package.
passport-local-mongoose

passport-local-mongoose takes care of salting and hashing user passwords, serializing and deserializing your user 
model (for session storage), and authenticating the username and password credentials with their stored counterparts 
in the mongo database.

It is a mongoose plugin first and foremost. It uses the passport-local module internally to provide and configure a 
LocalStrategy of local authentication for the passport module.

Before using this package make sure that you are using mongoose and are connected to a mongod instance in your app.

In app.js add the following require statement:
	
const passportLocalMongoose = require('passport-local-mongoose');

In our model class user.js:
	
const mongoose = require('mongoose'),
passportLocalMongoose = require('passport-local-mongoose');
const UserSchema =  new mongoose.Schema({});
UserSchema.plugin(passportLocalMongoose);
module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

The line UserSchema.plugin(passportLocalMongoose) is responsible for extending the model object.

According to the package documentation:

    Youâ€™re free to define your User how you like. Passport-Local Mongoose will add a username, hash and salt field to 
    store the username, the hashed password and the salt value.

    Additionally Passport-Local Mongoose adds some methods to your Schema. See the API Documentation section for more details. 

In app.js you add some configuration code for passport:
	
// requires the model with Passport-Local Mongoose plugged in
const User = require('./models/user');
  
// USE "createStrategy" INSTEAD OF "authenticate"
// This uses and configures passport-local behind the scenes
passport.use(User.createStrategy());
  
// use static serialize and deserialize of model for passport session support
passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser());
passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser());

passport-local-mongoose serializes and deserializes model objects based on the username field, so it should be unique 
to every model.

If mongoose is connected to mongod, this should be all the configuration code needed to use the 
passport-local-mongoose plugin.

To create a User, we can use the register method added by this plugin:
	
app.post('/register', (request, response) => {
    // Creates and saves a new user with a salt and hashed password
    User.register(new User({username: request.body.username}), request.body.password, function(err, user) {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
            return response.render('register');
        } else {
            passport.authenticate('local')(request, response, function() {
                response.redirect('/dashboard');
            });
        }
    });
});

Now, when a User is created and stored in the database, this is how it will be stored, as displayed in the mongo shell:
	
> show collections
users
> db.users.find()
{ 
  "_id" : ObjectId("5aea739b999c1e703ca7f093"), 
  "username" : "user", 
  "salt" : "2b3721324daf1f22a0f93cd70ce9bf55c2edad2ee5abaed5eb7e56485bc331af", 
  "hash" : "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", 
  "__v" : 0 }

Your User object is now available through request.user in an express app route callback after the user has been 
authenticated by passport.

passport-local-mongoose does not store the password, hash, and salt fields in the request.user object, however, out 
of safety concerns.
Making Your Own Middleware

After a user has been authenticated with passport in a session, you can use the isAuthenticated() method in the 
request object to determine if the user is logged in or not.

You can use this to make your own middleware for verifying if the user is logged in before accessing a certain route:
	
function isLoggedIn(request, response, next) {
    // passport adds this to the request object
    if (request.isAuthenticated()) {
        return next();
    }
    response.redirect('/login');
}

And here it is in action:

	
app.get('/dashboard', isLoggedIn, (request, response) => {
    // dashboard logic
});


Logging Out:

Passport includes a logout() function on request that can be called from a route handler. It removes the request.user 
property and clears the login session.
	
app.get('/logout', (request, response) => {
  request.logout();
  response.redirect('/');
});


*/


/* 

Passport essentially acts as a middleware and alters the value of the 'user' property in the req object to contain 
the deserialized identity of the user. To allow this to work correctly you must include serializeUser and 
deserializeUser functions in your custom code.

passport.serializeUser(function (user, done) {
    done(null, user.id);
});

passport.deserializeUser(function (user, done) {
    //If using Mongoose with MongoDB; if other you will need JS specific to that schema.
    User.findById(user.id, function (err, user) {
        done(err, user);
    });
});

This will find the correct user from the database and pass it as a closure variable into the callback done(err,user); 
so the above code in the passport.session() can replace the 'user' value in the req object and pass on to the next 
middleware in the pile.

passport.use(new localStrategy(User.authenticate())); // ask passport to use the localStrategy that we have required
// use static authenticate method of model in LocalStrategy. We can have multiple authentication Strategies set up
// simultanrously

Static methods

Static methods are exposed on the model constructor. For example to use createStrategy function use

const User = require('./models/user');
User.createStrategy();

  - authenticate() Generates a function that is used in Passport's LocalStrategy
  - serializeUser() Generates a function that is used by Passport to serialize users into the session
  - deserializeUser() Generates a function that is used by Passport to deserialize users into the session
  - register(user, password, cb) Convenience method to register a new user instance with a given password. 
    Checks if username is unique. See login example.
  - findByUsername() Convenience method to find a user instance by it's unique username.
  - createStrategy() Creates a configured passport-local LocalStrategy instance that can be used in passport.
