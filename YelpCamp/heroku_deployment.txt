Install heroku CLI:
curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh

Add neurodebian key if it is not available and then retry heroku CLI installation:
wget http://neuro.debian.net/_static/neuro.debian.net.asc
apt-key add neuro.debian.net.asc

You also require 'git' installed
sudo apt install git

After installation, login into Heroku:
heroku login

Go to the top level of your app repo where 'package.json' and 'app.js' are located,
and run the following to create app partition space:
git init
heroku create

change your mongoose database URL to the mongoDB Atlas cloud database url, your secret for encrypting sessions data
and all other ENV variables for deployment in production.

create a '.gitignore' file with the following content in the top-level of your app directory where 'package.json' and 'app.js' and '.env' are located:
"""
nodemodules
.env
"""

also add the following to the script object within 'package.json' (this will allow heroku to start the app when it calls 'npm start'):
 "start": "node app.js"
After adding this, your 'scripts' property in 'package.json' would be something like this:
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node app.js"
  },

Also make sure that the "main" property in 'package.json' is set to "app.js" because we renamed our main 
script in the app. By default when you run 'npm init -y', the 'main' property is set to 'index.js' which does not
match with our script name and will hence fail the deployment to Heroku.
Add nodejs as Buildpack from the Settings Pane of the App Dashboard in Heroku if it is unable to detect the language
of our app when pushing.



From the MongoDB Atlas Dashboard, go to Network Access, 'ADD IP ADDRESS' and use 'ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE'.
You can also pre-seed the MongoDB Atlas database that was created for app deployment in production if you want.

Push to remote Heroku repo:
git remote -v (to check remote repo is from Heroku. If heroku repo is not in the list, add it using 
'git remote add heroku <heroku_remote_git_url>' or 'heroku git:remote -a <shrouded-woodland-85681>')
git add .
git commit -m "ready for deployment"
git push heroku main

Check heroku logs:
heroku logs --tail

Set up Environment Variables for the app in the production environment of Heroku from the Settings tab of the app.
click on 'Reveal Config Vars' and Add the Key - Value pairs
Copy The Key name and Value from our '.env' file, or use the command-line and run the following from the top-level of the app repo:
heroku config:set <KEY>=<VALUE>
