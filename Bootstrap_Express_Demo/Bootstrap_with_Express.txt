To include Bootstrap in Express apps, download the 'Compiled CSS and JS' files from the Official Bootstrap Website.
(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/download/). Extract the downloaded file.
Move/Copy 'bootstrap-5.1.3-dist/css/bootstrap.min.css' into 'public/css'.
Similarly, move/copy 'bootstrap-5.1.3-dist/js/bootstrap.min.js' into 'public/js'. 
Also copy the respective .map files if you want. These *.map files will help in debugging the ugly/minified code that is 
present in bootstrap.min.css and bootstrap.min.js by allowing you to see the original code. Without the map files,
any errors will appear cryptic and difficult to debug given the minified code. Browsers can use the map file to help
developers view production code.
